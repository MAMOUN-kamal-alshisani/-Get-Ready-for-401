# How to Solve Programming Problems:

## The most common mistake when someone is try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.

## what to do:
1. ***You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.***
2. ***Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.***

## simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem:


1. ***Read the problem completely twice.***
2. ***Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.***
3. ***Optimize the manual steps.***
4. ***Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.***
5. ***Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.***
6. ***Optimize the real code.***

## Act like you make $1000/hr:

***most people may waste their time on unproductive things and just being busy doing what ever it is they are doing, without valuing there time and how much it is worth ,so 
one must be focused on being productive and benefite from every moment they are spending.***

## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving:

***Why is this important?***
***Problem solving is the meta-skill.**

***We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.***

***Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):***

* Try a solution.
* If that doesn’t work, try another one.
* If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
* Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.

***The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.***

***“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.
Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.
Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report)***


## 5 Whys:
***When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis***

***You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.***


## How to Use the 5 Whys:
1. ***Assemble a Team***
2. ***Define the Problem***
3. ***Ask the First "Why?"***
4. ***Ask "Why?" Four More Times***
5. ***Know When to Stop***
